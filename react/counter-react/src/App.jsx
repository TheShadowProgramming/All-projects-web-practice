// react project vite bundler se banaate apan, scripts se dev command samajh liya humne
// and then we install all the node modules in order to run vite commands
// app.jsx se we import the functions in the main.jsx and uske andar hi we use the .render syntax
// jsx functions are called when we use the / operator after the name of the function inside the 
// in order to return html using the jsx syntax, <> and </> is used inside the return function
// we can't write logic in evaluated expressions, variables in these evaluated expressions can be used using the {} syntax
// without using the $ sign, and this is what central state is I mean an array of object with different properties
// babel works under the hood and converts all the modern jsx syntax into vanilla js 
// in order to support jsx syntax in old browsers and all types of browsers
// hooks are special functions which helps us to update the variables (basically state)
// useState returns one variable and a function to manipulate that variable in an array
// the inputs passed in the hook are initialized to the variable, and if we want to update the variable
// then we call that function again with another input, which will be reflected everywhere
// react fiber algo does incremental rendering under the hood,
// it does 3-4 things :- a. prioritizes some operations over the other like updating animations more frequently than updating the cart 
// b. aborts certain updating operations when necessary like har update of the DOM pe react doesn't changes it, it waits for a certain number of time/operations
// React fiber also under the hood performs all the operations related to diffing between all the versions of Virtual DOM objects
// when we run npm run build then a build folder is created which has all the code which is pushed into production or for the browser to understand
