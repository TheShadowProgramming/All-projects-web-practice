# Accessbility Principles 



# Use html semantic defining tags present in the htmlLearned.md file 

- Also there are attributes like aria-current (something accessible in full form)
- for more accessibility we use the aria-current attribute, it can take many values like page when element ek page me ho and when the element is present in some step like some form then the attribute takes the value
- the aria-current can take another value which can be true or false which means that the current element is active or not or some other page is open right now
