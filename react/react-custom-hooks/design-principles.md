# Minimal and aesthetic design in that minimalism

- The design should always be minimal instead of being some fancy stuff
- minimal design of the website makes it predictable that it'll be liked by majority of our target audience 

# Constant giving the user about the feedback of their actions 
1. Constantly show the user about the system’s state so that the user can get idea about the results of their previous actions and can decide the further actions
    1. immediately show the results of their actions to the user (like as fast as possible)

# Simple language and terms for decreasing the cognitive load from the user
2. Use terms which are familiar to your target audience and like the point is that the user shouldn’t look up for definition of some word or some part on the website 
    1. don’t assume that the stuff that you know is also common for your audience too, always pre-check through surveys and stuff what are the terms that your users know

# Easy mechanism to help users to rectify their mistakes and interruptions in between certain actions which are caused by the user by mistake 
3. Support features like cancel button in any operation that is present in the web app and also support redo and undo type of stuff in the web app
    1. This makes sure that user feels confident about their actions like they can go back and correct their mistakes which makes the website more user friendly
    2. Like also designing methods which users can use to backtrack their mistakes and solve them 

# Make the website more predictable by following the industry norms and keeping most of the things predictable for the user
4. Follow the industry norms by bringing out features and patterns present in other websites like the shortcuts and stuff which reduces the cognitive load off the user
5. Prioritize errors like solve high-cost errors prone problems in the website like prevent users from doing these type of errors
    1. Then care about the little frustrations that users face and also make sure that you avoid users take the path by blocking certain actions to avoid errors
    2. Also reduce the information that the users have to remember when it comes to surfing your website like making labels and stuff 
    3. **Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the 
    interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both 
    inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent 
    actions.**
    4. For complex websites we need documentation too where we’re specifically dealing with expert audience only
